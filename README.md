# todo_test

A Flutter project for a task scheduler app based on deadlines scheduling 
where task are organised based on priority and deadline as 
users are asked to add a task with the time before it must be completed and then add a priority 
to the task, those tasks are then scheduled by an algorithm which provides a time limit window 
for user to complete the task and reminding them when the time window arrives thus giving user 
freedom from worrying about the task and when they should start working on it.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
